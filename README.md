# Workforce-UI-Clone

## Description

This was my **second project**, and I focused on making it **responsive** across different screen sizes.  
I practiced **media queries**, **flexbox**, and **CSS grid** while ensuring the layout stays clean and structured with semantic HTML.

---

## Features

-   Consistent use of `rem` units for scalable sizing.
-   Preferred **padding over margin** for spacing.
-   Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for better structure.
-   Embedded a YouTube video.
-   Combined **Flexbox** and **Grid** for layouts.
-   Fully **responsive design** for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Learnings

-   Gained a deeper understanding of **CSS Grid** (initially challenging but rewarding).
-   Learned that **fixed widths break responsiveness**.
-   Understood how **media queries** adapt layouts smoothly.
-   In Grid layouts, cards arrange automatically in rows â€” only the **columns** need adjusting in media queries.
-   Avoided using horizontal margins on parent containers for cleaner layouts.
